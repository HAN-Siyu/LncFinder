The original results of our experiments are included in this folder. 

For the sequences containing some non-nucleotide character (such as "X"), which is very common for some poor-explored species, CPC may throw an error and stop the process and CNCI may omit these sequences automatically. In our tests, CPC cannot identify the protein coding transcripts (pct) of zebrafish, and thus only the result of lncRNAs was obtained. We also notice that CNCI omitted 7 lncRNAs and 6 protein coding transcripts (pct) of chicken; 13 protein coding transcripts (pct) of zebrafish automatically. Since other tools CPAT, PLEK and LncFinder function normally, we regarded the classification results of these omitted sequences as incorrect to have a fair comparison.
